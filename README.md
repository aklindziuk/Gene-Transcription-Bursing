# Gene-Transcription-Bursing

summer 2018

Transcription is the first step of gene expression in living organisms. Interestingly, it is not a constant process. Rather, transciption happens in bursts. Therefore, we can think of transcription of having different states of activity. For example, a two state model of transcription is where the there are an ON and an OFF state. In the ON state, mRNAs are being generated, and in the OFF state they are not. In both states mRNAs are degraded by the same rate. However, it is possible for transcription to have more than two states, with each state having different generation rate, and different state transition constatns. These simulation implement Gillespie stochastic algorithm to sumulate the transciption system in its various scenarios.
